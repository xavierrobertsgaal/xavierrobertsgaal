# Hi, I’m @xavierrobertsgaal

I'm a PhD student in [Harvard's Moral Psychology Research Lab](https://cushmanlab.fas.harvard.edu/).

I study 🧐 **how we learn to do the right thing** 🧠 with Prof. Fiery Cushman and others!

Currently, I'm interested in:
- the contributions of culture, individual learning, and core knowledge to our moral sense
- the role of character in moral judgment
- AI alignment
- resource-rational models of cognition
- theory of deep learning

If any of this sounds interesting, feel free to drop me an email: xavierrobertsgaal [at] g [dot] harvard [dot] edu

Have a great rest of your day! 🌟🌻
